23,English,Reading Comprehension,Easy,Practice,"The Great Wall of China is one of the most remarkable architectural achievements in human history. Contrary to popular belief, it is not a single continuous wall but rather a series of walls and fortifications built over centuries by various Chinese dynasties. The earliest sections were constructed as far back as the 7th century BC, while the most well-known portions were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD). The total length of all sections ever built is estimated to be over 21,000 kilometers. The wall was primarily designed to protect Chinese states from invasions by nomadic groups from the north. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world, drawing millions of visitors annually. During which dynasty were the most well-known sections built?",Han Dynasty,Tang Dynasty,Song Dynasty,Ming Dynasty,Qin Dynasty,D,"The passage states 'the most well-known portions were built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644 AD).'",
24,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Practice,"Artificial intelligence has rapidly evolved from a theoretical concept to a transformative technology that touches nearly every aspect of modern life. Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed, leading to breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. Deep learning, which uses artificial neural networks inspired by the human brain, has been particularly revolutionary, achieving superhuman performance in tasks like playing complex games and diagnosing medical conditions from imaging scans. However, the rise of AI has also sparked significant ethical debates. Concerns about job displacement, algorithmic bias, privacy invasion, and the potential development of superintelligent systems that could act beyond human control have led to calls for robust regulation and governance frameworks. Researchers emphasize the importance of developing AI systems that are transparent, fair, and aligned with human values. According to the passage, what has deep learning achieved?",Only theoretical advances,Complete replacement of human workers,Perfect elimination of all biases,Superhuman performance in certain tasks,Full autonomous governance,D,"The passage states deep learning has achieved 'superhuman performance in tasks like playing complex games and diagnosing medical conditions from imaging scans.'",
25,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Practice,"The human microbiome consists of trillions of microorganisms living in and on our bodies, primarily in the gut. These microscopic organisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes, outnumber human cells and play essential roles in digestion, immune system regulation, and even mental health through the gut-brain axis. Recent research has revealed that the composition of an individual's microbiome is influenced by factors such as diet, environment, medication use (particularly antibiotics), and mode of birth delivery. Studies have linked imbalances in the gut microbiome, known as dysbiosis, to conditions ranging from inflammatory bowel disease and obesity to depression and autoimmune disorders. Scientists are now exploring therapeutic approaches such as fecal microbiota transplantation, targeted probiotics, and personalized nutrition plans to restore healthy microbial balance. The field of microbiome research has grown exponentially, with many experts believing it could revolutionize personalized medicine. What is dysbiosis?",A type of beneficial bacteria,A medical treatment,A digestive enzyme,A type of probiotic,An imbalance in the gut microbiome,E,"The passage defines dysbiosis as 'imbalances in the gut microbiome.'",
26,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Practice,"The concept of neuroplasticity has fundamentally changed our understanding of the human brain. Previously, scientists believed that the brain's structure was essentially fixed after childhood, but decades of research have demonstrated that the brain continues to reorganize itself throughout life by forming new neural connections. This ability allows neurons to compensate for injury, adjust their activities in response to new situations, and adapt to changes in the environment. Studies of London taxi drivers, for example, showed that their hippocampi—the brain region associated with spatial memory—were significantly larger than average, having grown through years of navigating complex city streets. Neuroplasticity also underlies the brain's ability to recover function after strokes or traumatic injuries, though the extent of recovery varies greatly among individuals. Understanding neuroplasticity has led to new therapeutic approaches for conditions such as PTSD, chronic pain, and learning disabilities, often involving targeted repetitive exercises designed to strengthen specific neural pathways. What did the study of London taxi drivers demonstrate?",Their hippocampi were significantly larger due to spatial navigation,Their brains were smaller than average,They had fewer neural connections,Their memory declined over time,They could not adapt to new routes,A,"The passage states 'their hippocampi—the brain region associated with spatial memory—were significantly larger than average, having grown through years of navigating complex city streets.'",
27,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Practice,"The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century, fundamentally transformed human society from agrarian economies to industrial powerhouses. The introduction of steam power, mechanized textile manufacturing, and iron production techniques enabled unprecedented economic growth but also created significant social upheaval. Workers migrated from rural areas to rapidly growing cities, often living in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Child labor was widespread, with children as young as five working in mines and factories for up to 16 hours a day. The Luddite movement of 1811-1816 saw textile workers destroying machinery they believed threatened their livelihoods, representing one of the first organized responses to technological unemployment. Eventually, reform movements led to labor laws, public health improvements, and the rise of trade unions. The revolution also had profound environmental consequences, initiating the large-scale burning of fossil fuels that continues to drive climate change today. What was the Luddite movement?",A political party advocating for workers,A movement to improve factory conditions,Textile workers destroying machinery that threatened their jobs,A group promoting new technology,A trade union organization,C,"The passage describes the Luddite movement as 'textile workers destroying machinery they believed threatened their livelihoods.'",
28,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Practice,"Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, supporting approximately 25% of all marine species despite covering less than 1% of the ocean floor. Often called the 'rainforests of the sea,' these structures are built over thousands of years by tiny animals called coral polyps, which secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons. Coral reefs provide essential services to both marine life and human communities, including coastal protection from storms, nursery habitats for commercially important fish species, and potential sources of new medicines. However, reefs worldwide are under severe threat from climate change, which causes ocean warming and acidification. When water temperatures rise even 1-2 degrees Celsius above normal, corals expel their symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) in a process known as bleaching, which can lead to coral death if prolonged. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced multiple mass bleaching events in recent years, with scientists warning that without significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, most of the world's coral reefs could be lost by 2050. What causes coral bleaching?",Pollution from ships,Overfishing near reef areas,Excessive sunlight exposure,Rising water temperatures causing corals to expel symbiotic algae,Lack of calcium carbonate,D,"The passage explains that 'When water temperatures rise even 1-2 degrees Celsius above normal, corals expel their symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) in a process known as bleaching.'",
29,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Practice,"The Rosetta Stone, discovered in 1799 by French soldiers in Egypt, became one of the most important archaeological finds in history because it provided the key to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. The stone contains the same text written in three scripts: hieroglyphic (used for official documents), Demotic (the common script of Egypt), and ancient Greek (the language of the administration). French scholar Jean-François Champollion is credited with the breakthrough decipherment in 1822, after years of painstaking work comparing the Greek text with the hieroglyphic symbols. His work revealed that hieroglyphics were not purely symbolic or pictographic as previously assumed, but represented a complex writing system combining logographic, alphabetic, and determinative elements. This discovery opened up the entire field of Egyptology, allowing scholars to read thousands of previously incomprehensible inscriptions on temples, tombs, and papyri. The Rosetta Stone has been housed in the British Museum since 1802, though Egypt has repeatedly requested its return. What was the key insight Champollion discovered about hieroglyphics?",They were purely pictographic,They were identical to Greek,They could only represent numbers,They were a form of Demotic script,They were a complex system combining logographic alphabetic and determinative elements,E,"The passage states hieroglyphics 'represented a complex writing system combining logographic, alphabetic, and determinative elements.'",
30,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Practice,"Sleep is a fundamental biological process that remains partially mysterious to scientists despite decades of research. During sleep, the brain cycles through several stages, including light sleep, deep sleep, and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, with each stage serving different functions. Deep sleep is crucial for physical restoration, immune function, and memory consolidation, while REM sleep—when most vivid dreaming occurs—appears important for emotional processing and creative problem-solving. The glymphatic system, discovered in 2012, was found to be significantly more active during sleep, clearing toxic waste products including beta-amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease from the brain. Chronic sleep deprivation has been linked to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, depression, and impaired cognitive function. Despite recommendations of 7-9 hours per night for adults, studies indicate that approximately one-third of adults in developed countries regularly get less than the recommended amount of sleep. What role does the glymphatic system play during sleep?",It produces dreams,It regulates body temperature,It clears toxic waste products from the brain,It controls muscle movement,It produces melatonin,C,"The passage states the glymphatic system 'clearing toxic waste products including beta-amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease from the brain.'",
31,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Mock,"Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift from classical computing by harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways. While classical computers use bits that exist as either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously. This property, combined with quantum entanglement—where qubits become correlated so that the state of one instantly influences another regardless of distance—enables quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical machines. Potential applications include breaking current encryption systems, simulating molecular interactions for drug discovery, optimizing complex logistics problems, and advancing artificial intelligence. However, significant technical challenges remain, including maintaining qubit coherence (qubits are extremely sensitive to environmental interference), error correction, and scaling up to enough qubits for practical advantage. Major technology companies and governments are investing billions in quantum research, though experts debate whether practical quantum advantage for most real-world problems is years or decades away. What is superposition in quantum computing?",A qubit being either 0 or 1,Two qubits being entangled,A quantum error correction method,A qubit existing in both 0 and 1 states simultaneously,A type of quantum encryption,D,"The passage explains that qubits 'can exist in a superposition of both states simultaneously.'",
32,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Mock,"The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 is often cited as one of the most important breakthroughs in medical history. Fleming noticed that a mold called Penicillium notatum had contaminated one of his bacterial cultures and created a zone where bacteria could not grow. However, it took over a decade before Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain developed methods to mass-produce penicillin, which became widely available during World War II and saved countless lives from battlefield infections. The antibiotic revolution that followed transformed medicine, making previously fatal infections treatable and enabling complex surgeries. Yet today, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both human medicine and agriculture has accelerated the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or 'superbugs.' The World Health Organization has declared antimicrobial resistance one of the top ten global public health threats, warning that without intervention, common infections could once again become deadly. New approaches including phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides, and CRISPR-based techniques are being explored as alternatives. Why has antibiotic resistance become a major concern?",Overuse has accelerated evolution of resistant bacteria,Antibiotics are too expensive to produce,Penicillin is no longer effective against any bacteria,Bacteria have always been resistant,New antibiotics are being discovered too quickly,A,"The passage states 'the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both human medicine and agriculture has accelerated the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.'",
33,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Mock,"The concept of emotional intelligence (EI), popularized by psychologist Daniel Goleman in 1995, refers to the ability to recognize, understand, manage, and effectively use emotions in oneself and others. Unlike traditional IQ, which measures cognitive abilities such as logic, reasoning, and problem-solving, EI encompasses skills like empathy, self-awareness, social awareness, and relationship management. Research has shown that emotional intelligence is a stronger predictor of workplace success than IQ in many professions, particularly those involving leadership, teamwork, and customer interaction. Studies indicate that leaders with high EI create more positive work environments, experience lower team turnover, and achieve better organizational outcomes. Critics argue that EI is difficult to measure objectively and may overlap significantly with personality traits like agreeableness and conscientiousness. Nevertheless, many organizations now incorporate EI assessments into their hiring processes and leadership development programs, recognizing that technical competence alone is insufficient for professional excellence. How does EI differ from traditional IQ according to the passage?",EI is easier to measure,EI only matters in leadership roles,EI encompasses empathy self-awareness and relationship management rather than logic and reasoning,EI and IQ are essentially the same,EI replaces the need for cognitive abilities,C,"The passage distinguishes EI as encompassing 'skills like empathy, self-awareness, social awareness, and relationship management' versus IQ which 'measures cognitive abilities such as logic, reasoning, and problem-solving.'",
34,English,Reading Comprehension,Hard,Practice,"The theory of plate tectonics, which became widely accepted in the 1960s, provides a unifying framework for understanding Earth's geological activity, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, mountain building, and the creation of ocean trenches. According to this theory, Earth's outermost layer (the lithosphere) is divided into several large and numerous smaller tectonic plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath. These plates move at rates of a few centimeters per year, driven by convection currents in the mantle, ridge push at mid-ocean ridges, and slab pull at subduction zones. At convergent boundaries, where plates collide, one plate may be forced beneath another (subduction), creating deep ocean trenches and volcanic arcs—this process is responsible for the Pacific Ring of Fire, which hosts 75% of the world's active volcanoes. At divergent boundaries, plates move apart, allowing magma to rise and create new oceanic crust, as seen at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Transform boundaries, where plates slide past each other horizontally, produce significant seismic activity, as exemplified by the San Andreas Fault in California. The theory also explains why fossils of the same species are found on continents now separated by vast oceans—these landmasses were once joined in the supercontinent Pangaea approximately 335 million years ago. What drives the movement of tectonic plates?",Only gravitational pull,Solar energy heating the surface,Ocean currents pushing the plates,Volcanic eruptions forcing plates apart,Convection currents in the mantle along with ridge push and slab pull,E,"The passage states plates are 'driven by convection currents in the mantle, ridge push at mid-ocean ridges, and slab pull at subduction zones.'",
35,English,Reading Comprehension,Hard,Practice,"Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression that occur without alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Unlike genetic mutations, which involve changes to the nucleotide sequence itself, epigenetic modifications affect how genes are read and expressed by the cellular machinery. The most well-studied epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation (the addition of methyl groups to cytosine bases, typically silencing gene expression), histone modifications (chemical changes to the protein spools around which DNA is wound, affecting how tightly DNA is packaged), and non-coding RNA molecules that can regulate gene expression at various levels. These modifications can be influenced by environmental factors such as diet, stress, toxin exposure, and even social interactions. Perhaps most remarkably, some epigenetic changes can be transmitted across generations—studies of the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-45 showed that children and even grandchildren of women who experienced famine during pregnancy had higher rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and mental health issues, suggesting that the nutritional stress experienced by the grandmother altered epigenetic marks passed to subsequent generations. This challenges the traditional view that inheritance is solely determined by DNA sequence and has profound implications for understanding how environment and lifestyle can influence health outcomes across generations. What makes epigenetic inheritance remarkable according to the passage?",Some epigenetic changes can be transmitted across multiple generations,It only affects the individual exposed to environmental factors,It completely replaces DNA-based inheritance,It only occurs in plant species,It requires direct genetic mutations,A,"The passage describes how 'some epigenetic changes can be transmitted across generations' and provides the Dutch Hunger Winter example showing effects in children and grandchildren.",
36,English,Reading Comprehension,Hard,Practice,"The placebo effect, long dismissed as mere psychological trickery, has emerged as a complex neurobiological phenomenon with significant implications for medical research and clinical practice. When patients receive inert treatments they believe to be real medicine, measurable physiological changes can occur, including the release of endogenous opioids, dopamine, and serotonin, activation of specific brain regions, and even alterations in immune function. Remarkably, research has shown that placebos can still work even when patients know they are receiving a placebo (so-called 'open-label placebos'), suggesting that the therapeutic ritual and patient-provider relationship contribute independently to healing. The nocebo effect—where negative expectations produce harmful outcomes—is equally real, with patients experiencing genuine side effects from inert substances when warned about potential adverse reactions. These findings have led to ethical debates about whether doctors should prescribe placebos and how clinical trials should account for the varying strength of placebo responses across different conditions. Placebo effects are particularly strong in pain management, depression, and irritable bowel syndrome, but minimal in conditions like cancer tumor reduction or bone fracture healing. Understanding the placebo effect has also highlighted the importance of the therapeutic alliance—the quality of the doctor-patient relationship—as a genuine component of medical treatment efficacy. What are open-label placebos?",Placebos given without the patient's knowledge,Placebos that contain small amounts of active ingredients,Placebos used only in clinical trials,Placebos that work even when patients know they are receiving a placebo,Placebos that have no measurable effect,D,"The passage defines open-label placebos as cases where 'placebos can still work even when patients know they are receiving a placebo.'",
37,English,Reading Comprehension,Hard,Practice,"The tragedy of the commons, a concept articulated by ecologist Garrett Hardin in 1968, describes a situation where individual users acting independently and rationally according to their own self-interest behave contrary to the common good of all users by depleting or spoiling a shared resource. Hardin illustrated this with the example of herders sharing a common pasture: each herder has an incentive to add more cattle because they personally benefit from each additional animal while the cost of overgrazing is shared among all. The concept has been applied to numerous environmental challenges, including overfishing, deforestation, air pollution, and climate change—where individual nations or corporations benefit from carbon emissions while the costs are borne globally. However, Nobel laureate Elinor Ostrom challenged Hardin's pessimistic conclusion that only privatization or government regulation could prevent commons tragedies. Through extensive fieldwork studying communities worldwide, she identified eight design principles that enabled communities to successfully self-govern shared resources without external authority, including clearly defined boundaries, collective decision-making, graduated sanctions for rule violators, and accessible conflict resolution mechanisms. Her work demonstrated that humans are capable of cooperative resource management when institutional conditions are right, offering a middle path between market and state solutions. How did Elinor Ostrom challenge Hardin's conclusions?",She proved the tragedy of the commons doesn't exist,She argued only government regulation works,She showed communities can self-govern shared resources through specific institutional principles,She demonstrated privatization is always the best solution,She proved individuals always act in the common good,C,"The passage states Ostrom 'identified eight design principles that enabled communities to successfully self-govern shared resources without external authority.'",
38,English,Reading Comprehension,Hard,Practice,"The development of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has been described as one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs of the 21st century. Originally discovered as a bacterial immune defense mechanism against viruses, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) was adapted by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier into a precise molecular tool capable of cutting DNA at specific locations, enabling researchers to delete, replace, or insert genetic material with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. The technology has already been used to develop disease-resistant crops, create animal models for studying human diseases, and advance gene therapy treatments for conditions like sickle cell disease and certain cancers. In 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui controversially created the first gene-edited babies, modifying the CCR5 gene in an attempt to confer HIV resistance—an act widely condemned by the scientific community for its premature application and ethical violations. This event intensified debates about germline editing (modifications that are inherited by future generations), the potential for 'designer babies,' equitable access to gene therapies, and the ecological risks of gene drives that could alter entire wild populations. International governance frameworks remain fragmented, with different countries adopting vastly different regulatory approaches. What was controversial about He Jiankui's experiment?",He used CRISPR on plants without permission,He patented CRISPR technology,He refused to publish his research,He only tested on animals,He created the first gene-edited babies which was condemned as premature and ethically violating,E,"The passage describes his creation of 'the first gene-edited babies' as 'an act widely condemned by the scientific community for its premature application and ethical violations.'",
39,English,Reading Comprehension,Easy,Mock,"Honey bees are among the most important pollinators in the world, responsible for pollinating approximately 75% of the fruits, nuts, and vegetables grown globally. A single bee colony can contain up to 60,000 workers, all of which are female. The queen bee is the only member that reproduces, laying up to 2,000 eggs per day during peak season. Worker bees communicate the location of food sources through a sophisticated 'waggle dance,' in which the angle and duration of the dance indicate the direction and distance of flowers relative to the sun. Despite their importance, bee populations worldwide have been declining due to a combination of factors including pesticide exposure, habitat loss, parasitic mites (particularly Varroa destructor), and diseases. This decline, sometimes called Colony Collapse Disorder, poses a serious threat to global food security. How do worker bees communicate food source locations?",Through chemical signals only,By leading other bees directly to the source,Through sound vibrations in the hive,Through a waggle dance indicating direction and distance,They cannot communicate locations,D,"The passage explains bees use 'a sophisticated waggle dance, in which the angle and duration of the dance indicate the direction and distance of flowers relative to the sun.'",
40,English,Reading Comprehension,Easy,Mock,"The human eye is a remarkable organ capable of distinguishing approximately 10 million different colors. Light enters through the cornea, passes through the pupil (which adjusts its size to control the amount of light entering), and is focused by the lens onto the retina at the back of the eye. The retina contains two types of photoreceptor cells: rods, which are sensitive to dim light and provide black-and-white vision, and cones, which function in bright light and enable color vision. There are approximately 120 million rods and 6 million cones in each human eye. The fovea, a small pit in the center of the retina, contains the highest concentration of cones and provides the sharpest central vision. Signals from the photoreceptors are processed by the retina and transmitted via the optic nerve to the visual cortex of the brain, where they are interpreted as images. What is the function of rod cells in the eye?",They are sensitive to dim light and provide black-and-white vision,They enable color vision,They focus light onto the retina,They control pupil size,They transmit signals to the brain,A,"The passage states rods 'are sensitive to dim light and provide black-and-white vision.'",
41,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Mock,"The phenomenon of bioluminescence—the production of light by living organisms—occurs across a remarkably diverse range of species, from deep-sea fish and jellyfish to fireflies, fungi, and certain bacteria. In the ocean, where sunlight cannot penetrate below about 200 meters, an estimated 76% of all marine organisms produce their own light. Bioluminescence typically results from a chemical reaction involving a light-emitting molecule called luciferin and an enzyme called luciferase, though the specific molecules vary among different organisms. Marine creatures use bioluminescence for multiple purposes: attracting prey (as seen in the anglerfish's glowing lure), evading predators through counter-illumination (matching the dim light from above to eliminate their shadow when viewed from below), communicating with potential mates, and startling attackers with sudden flashes. Some species, like the Hawaiian bobtail squid, host bioluminescent bacteria in specialized organs rather than producing light themselves, forming a symbiotic relationship. Scientists are now harnessing bioluminescent proteins for medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and genetic research, with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from jellyfish becoming one of the most important tools in modern biology. What is counter-illumination?",Producing light to attract prey,Using light to communicate with mates,Matching dim light from above to eliminate shadows when viewed from below,Startling predators with bright flashes,Hosting bacteria that produce light,C,"The passage defines counter-illumination as 'matching the dim light from above to eliminate their shadow when viewed from below.'",
42,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Mock,"The Silk Road was not a single road but a vast network of trade routes connecting East Asia with the Mediterranean world, spanning over 6,400 kilometers at its greatest extent. Active from approximately the 2nd century BC to the 15th century AD, these routes facilitated not only the trade of luxury goods such as silk, spices, precious metals, and gemstones, but also the exchange of ideas, religions, technologies, and diseases between civilizations. Buddhism spread from India to China along these routes, while Islam later traveled eastward. Paper-making technology moved from China to the Islamic world and eventually to Europe, fundamentally transforming knowledge preservation and dissemination. The Black Death of the 14th century is believed to have traveled along Silk Road trade networks from Central Asia to Europe, killing an estimated one-third of Europe's population. Caravanserais—roadside inns built at regular intervals—provided rest, food, and security for merchants and their animals. The maritime Silk Road, which developed parallel to the overland routes, connected Chinese ports with Southeast Asia, India, the Persian Gulf, and East Africa, carrying goods by sea that were too bulky or heavy for overland transport. According to the passage, what besides goods was exchanged along the Silk Road?",Only military strategies,Only agricultural products,Only artistic styles,Ideas religions technologies and diseases,Only political systems,D,"The passage states the routes facilitated 'the exchange of ideas, religions, technologies, and diseases between civilizations.'",
43,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Mock,"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. This process occurs primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells, specifically within structures called thylakoids that contain the green pigment chlorophyll. Photosynthesis consists of two main stages: the light-dependent reactions, which occur in the thylakoid membranes and produce ATP and NADPH using water and sunlight (releasing oxygen as a byproduct), and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions), which occurs in the stroma and uses the ATP and NADPH to fix carbon dioxide into glucose. The overall equation is: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂. Remarkably, photosynthesis is responsible for producing virtually all of the oxygen in Earth's atmosphere and forms the base of nearly every food chain on the planet. Recent research into artificial photosynthesis aims to replicate this process to produce clean hydrogen fuel and other useful chemicals, potentially offering a sustainable energy solution. Scientists have also discovered that some photosynthetic organisms can achieve near-perfect quantum efficiency in their light-harvesting complexes, a finding that could inform the design of more efficient solar cells. Where does the Calvin cycle occur?",In the thylakoid membranes,In the cell nucleus,In the stroma of chloroplasts,In the mitochondria,In the cell membrane,C,"The passage states the Calvin cycle 'occurs in the stroma.'",
44,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Mock,"The cognitive bias known as confirmation bias refers to the tendency of individuals to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms their pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses. First described systematically by psychologist Peter Wason in the 1960s, this bias affects decision-making across all domains, from everyday judgments to scientific research and political opinions. When people hold a strong belief, they unconsciously seek out evidence that supports it while dismissing or undervaluing contradictory information—a process that can create echo chambers in social media environments where algorithms further reinforce existing viewpoints. Confirmation bias is particularly dangerous in medical diagnosis, where doctors may prematurely fixate on an initial diagnosis and ignore symptoms that suggest alternative conditions. In criminal investigations, it can lead to tunnel vision, where investigators focus on a single suspect while overlooking exculpatory evidence. Strategies to counteract confirmation bias include actively seeking disconfirming evidence, considering alternative explanations, using structured decision-making frameworks, and fostering diverse teams that can challenge each other's assumptions. Research suggests that simply being aware of the bias is insufficient to overcome it—deliberate procedural safeguards are necessary. Why is confirmation bias particularly dangerous in medical diagnosis?",It makes treatments more expensive,It prevents doctors from using technology,It only affects inexperienced doctors,It makes patients less cooperative,Doctors may fixate on an initial diagnosis and ignore symptoms suggesting alternatives,E,"The passage states it is dangerous 'where doctors may prematurely fixate on an initial diagnosis and ignore symptoms that suggest alternative conditions.'",
45,English,Reading Comprehension,Medium,Mock,"The concept of compound interest, described by Albert Einstein as the 'eighth wonder of the world,' is a fundamental principle in finance where interest is calculated not only on the initial principal but also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. This creates an exponential growth curve rather than a linear one, meaning that money grows increasingly faster over time. For example, an investment of $10,000 at 7% annual compound interest would grow to approximately $19,672 in 10 years, $38,697 in 20 years, and $76,123 in 30 years—the money nearly doubles every decade without any additional contributions. The 'Rule of 72' provides a quick estimate: dividing 72 by the annual interest rate gives the approximate number of years required to double an investment (72 ÷ 7 ≈ 10.3 years). However, compound interest works against borrowers in the same way it benefits savers—credit card debt, for instance, can grow rapidly when interest compounds on unpaid balances. Understanding compound interest is essential for long-term financial planning, as even small differences in interest rates or starting age can result in dramatically different outcomes over decades. Financial advisors emphasize that time in the market is often more important than timing the market. What does the Rule of 72 calculate?",The approximate years needed to double an investment at a given rate,The maximum interest rate for an investment,The total return after 72 years,The minimum investment needed,The optimal age to start investing,A,"The passage explains the Rule of 72 as 'dividing 72 by the annual interest rate gives the approximate number of years required to double an investment.'",
46,English,Reading Comprehension,Hard,Mock,"The Fermi Paradox, named after physicist Enrico Fermi, addresses the apparent contradiction between the high probability estimates for the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations and the lack of evidence for, or contact with, such civilizations. Given that the Milky Way contains an estimated 100-400 billion stars, many with potentially habitable planets, and that the galaxy is approximately 13.6 billion years old—providing ample time for intelligent life to evolve and spread—Fermi famously asked, 'Where is everybody?' Numerous proposed solutions to this paradox fall into several categories. The 'Great Filter' hypothesis suggests that there is some extremely difficult evolutionary step that prevents most life from reaching an advanced technological stage—this filter could be behind us (making our existence extraordinarily rare) or ahead of us (suggesting that advanced civilizations inevitably destroy themselves). The 'Zoo Hypothesis' proposes that advanced aliens are deliberately avoiding contact, observing us like animals in a nature preserve. The 'Dark Forest' theory, popularized by Liu Cixin's science fiction, suggests that civilizations remain deliberately silent because revealing their location to unknown others is existentially dangerous. Other explanations include the vast distances making communication impractical, the possibility that we're looking for the wrong signals, or that advanced civilizations transcend into forms we cannot recognize. Recent discoveries of thousands of exoplanets have intensified this debate rather than resolving it. What does the Great Filter hypothesis propose?",Aliens are filtering our communications,Earth is protected by a cosmic barrier,Some extremely difficult evolutionary step prevents most life from reaching advanced technology,Only certain types of stars can support life,Communication signals are naturally filtered by cosmic dust,C,"The passage explains the Great Filter as 'some extremely difficult evolutionary step that prevents most life from reaching an advanced technological stage.'",
47,English,Reading Comprehension,Hard,Mock,"The phenomenon of linguistic relativity, also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, proposes that the structure of a language influences its speakers' worldview, cognition, and perception of reality. The strong version of this hypothesis (linguistic determinism) suggests that language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit cognitive categories—a position largely rejected by modern linguists. However, the weak version (linguistic influence) has received considerable empirical support. Studies have shown that speakers of languages with absolute spatial reference systems (such as the Australian Aboriginal language Guugu Yimithirr, which uses cardinal directions instead of relative terms like 'left' and 'right') maintain a constant awareness of compass orientation. Research on color perception has demonstrated that Russian speakers, whose language has separate basic terms for light blue (goluboy) and dark blue (siniy), can distinguish between these shades faster than English speakers, who use the single term 'blue.' The Hopi language's treatment of time—using evidentiality markers rather than tenses—was once cited as evidence for radically different temporal perception, though this claim has been disputed. Recent neurolinguistic studies using fMRI have shown that language-specific grammatical structures can activate different brain regions during perception tasks, suggesting that linguistic influence operates at a neural level. These findings have implications for artificial intelligence, translation theory, and understanding how bilingualism might provide cognitive flexibility. What does the weak version of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis claim?",Language completely determines all thought,Language has no effect on thought,Only written language affects cognition,Language influences but does not determine cognition and perception,Language only influences emotional responses,D,"The passage describes the weak version as 'linguistic influence' which 'has received considerable empirical support' through various studies showing language's influence on perception without determining it completely.",
48,English,Reading Comprehension,Hard,Mock,"The concept of emergence in complex systems describes how collective behaviors arise from the interactions of simpler components in ways that cannot be predicted from the properties of the individual parts alone. A classic example is consciousness emerging from networks of neurons—no single neuron is conscious, yet the organized activity of billions of neurons produces subjective experience. Similarly, the complex patterns of bird murmurations emerge from each bird following simple rules about spacing and alignment with its nearest neighbors, creating breathtaking aerial displays that appear choreographed despite having no central coordinator. Emergence operates at every scale of organization: atoms form molecules with novel chemical properties, molecules form cells capable of self-replication, cells form organisms with consciousness, organisms form societies with cultures. The study of emergence has profound philosophical implications, challenging reductionist approaches that seek to explain complex phenomena solely by analyzing their constituent parts. In economics, market behavior emerges from millions of individual transactions in ways that no single participant intends or controls—Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' is essentially a description of emergence. Understanding emergence has practical applications in designing resilient networks, developing artificial intelligence systems, predicting urban growth patterns, and managing ecosystems. However, the unpredictability inherent in emergent systems poses challenges for traditional scientific methods that rely on controlled experimentation and linear causality. Why does emergence challenge reductionism?",Because it proves individual parts don't exist,Because it shows simple rules don't exist in nature,Because collective behaviors cannot be predicted from properties of individual parts alone,Because reductionism is mathematically impossible,Because emergence only occurs in biological systems,C,"The passage states emergence shows 'collective behaviors arise from the interactions of simpler components in ways that cannot be predicted from the properties of the individual parts alone.'",
49,English,Reading Comprehension,Hard,Mock,"The Anthropocene, a proposed geological epoch, marks the period during which human activities have become the dominant influence on Earth's climate and environment. While the formal designation remains debated among geologists—with proposed start dates ranging from the advent of agriculture 12,000 years ago to the Great Acceleration of the mid-20th century—the evidence for humanity's planetary-scale impact is overwhelming. Humans have altered more than 75% of Earth's ice-free land surface, created over 170,000 synthetic minerals and materials (compared to the approximately 5,000 naturally occurring minerals), moved more sediment annually than all natural processes combined, and increased atmospheric CO₂ concentrations by over 50% above pre-industrial levels. The proposed 'golden spike'—a stratigraphic marker that would officially define the epoch's beginning—includes plutonium-239 from nuclear weapons testing, microplastics, concrete, and aluminum in sedimentary layers. Critics of the Anthropocene concept argue that it oversimplifies human impacts by treating humanity as a monolithic force when in reality, a small minority of the global population is responsible for the majority of environmental degradation. Others contend that formally adopting the term could either galvanize environmental action by emphasizing human responsibility or paradoxically normalize ecological destruction by framing it as an inevitable geological process. The International Commission on Stratigraphy has not yet formally ratified the Anthropocene as an official epoch. What criticism do some scholars make about the Anthropocene concept?",It exaggerates human environmental impact,It ignores geological evidence entirely,It was proposed too recently to be valid,It only considers climate change,It oversimplifies by treating humanity as monolithic when a minority causes most degradation,E,"The passage states 'Critics argue that it oversimplifies human impacts by treating humanity as a monolithic force when in reality, a small minority of the global population is responsible for the majority of environmental degradation.'",
50,English,Reading Comprehension,Hard,Mock,"The paradox of tolerance, formulated by philosopher Karl Popper in 1945, states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant will eventually be destroyed by the intolerant. Popper argued that while a tolerant society should tolerate all viewpoints as a default, it must retain the right to suppress intolerant ideologies when they refuse to engage in rational debate and instead resort to violence or the incitement of violence. This creates a philosophical tension: at what point does suppressing intolerance become itself a form of intolerance? Popper's resolution was that tolerance should be understood not as a moral absolute but as a social contract—those who reject the principles of mutual respect and rational discourse effectively place themselves outside the agreement. The paradox has gained renewed relevance in debates about free speech on social media platforms, where algorithms can amplify extremist content while content moderation decisions inevitably involve value judgments about acceptable expression. Legal frameworks vary significantly across democracies: the United States' First Amendment provides broad speech protections with narrow exceptions, while many European countries criminalize hate speech and Holocaust denial. Some scholars have proposed 'militant democracy' as a framework where democratic systems can limit certain anti-democratic movements to preserve democracy itself—a concept implemented in Germany's Basic Law, which allows the banning of political parties deemed hostile to the democratic order. These debates highlight the inherent tension between protecting individual liberty and preserving the conditions that make liberty possible. How did Popper resolve the paradox of tolerance?",By framing tolerance as a social contract that excludes those who reject rational discourse,By arguing all speech should be unlimited,By suggesting only government can determine acceptable speech,By proving intolerance is always wrong,By eliminating the concept of tolerance entirely,A,"The passage explains Popper's resolution: 'tolerance should be understood not as a moral absolute but as a social contract—those who reject the principles of mutual respect and rational discourse effectively place themselves outside the agreement.'",
